# ModernRoboticsCMCTest
This is a very sloppily-written application to run motors off of a Modern Robotics Core Motor Controller, written in C#. It doesn't currently support the use of encoders. The library used is here: https://modernroboticsinc.com/download/core-control-modules-library/

We're using this to run a motor to be used as a part of a turntable to showcase our robot in our pit. 

To edit the source code, make sure to download the library linked above and add it as a reference to the project.

To use this program, head over to the [releases tab](https://github.com/ftcgrizzlybots11918/ModernRoboticsCMCTest/releases) and download the latest release, which should be a zip file. Then extract it, and run it, and you should be good to go.
